installing guest additions console only, use sudo:
mount /dev/cdrom /mnt
cd /mnt
./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
reboot

 sudo adduser your_vm_username vboxsf
 replace vboxsf with your custom mount location if you customized it

no desktop no clipboard if you're raw console only
also note - probably better off sshing into it with a terminal so you get a proper terminal, i found the raw console to struggle with applications that expect a proper terminal.
